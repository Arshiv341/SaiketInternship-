        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello everyone, I’m <strong>Ritik Tiwari</strong>. In this post, I want to share a clear and realistic path for anyone who dreams of becoming a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong>.

          Let’s go step by step so that you can start your journey with confidence.
